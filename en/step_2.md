![A screenshot of the right pane in the Unity Hub. The filename and the 'Create Project' sections are highlighted in red.](images/create-project.png)

Your new project will open in the Unity Editor. It may take some time to load.

Download and unzip the [More Unity starter package](https://rpf.io/p/en/rainbow-run-go){:target="_blank"} to your computer. 

**Tip:** Choose a sensible location such as your Documents folder.

The Unity starter package you downloaded for this More Unity path contains a number of **Assets** for you to use in your project.

To import them into your new project, click on the **Assets menu** and select **Import package > Custom Packageâ€¦** then navigate to the downloaded Unity starter package.

--- task ---

In the Inspector window, change the Transform properties of the '8x8Floor' GameObject: Position X=`0`, Y=`0`, Z=`0`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

In the Hierarchy window, right-click on the '8x8Floor' GameObject and select **Create Empty Parent**. 

A new parent 'GameObject' will be created:

![The Hierarchy window with the 'Floor' GameObject nested inside a new object called 'GameObject'.](images/empty-parent.png)

Right-click on the new GameObject and rename it to 'Dance Floor':

![The Inspector window with the name property highlighted and the typed name 'Dance Floor'.](images/rename-gameobject.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the Hierarchy window you can see that the 'Floor' GameObject contains 64 individually numbered cubes.

Click on the 'Cube' GameObject. Hold down the <kbd>shift</kbd> and scroll to the bottom of the list of cubes then click on 'Cube.0063'. All of the cubes will be highlighted:
