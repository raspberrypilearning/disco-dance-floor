If you are following the [More Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/more-unity) path, you can move on to the [Don't fall through](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dont-fall-through) project. In this project, you will create a multiplayer tile game where players have to race to find a safe path across the floor!

![An image of the finished Don't Fall Through project showing two controllable balls and a grid of 64 tiles. The balls can each be controlled by a different player using keyboard keys. The aim is to get to the platform past the grid of tiles. The tiles change colour when you roll the ball on to them. Some are safe, others fall away.](images/DFTcomplete.png)
