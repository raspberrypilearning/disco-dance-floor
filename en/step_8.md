## What next?

If you are following the [More Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/more-unity) path, you can move on to the [Don't fall through](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dont-fall-through) project. In this project, you will make a tiltable disco dance floor with tiles that light-up and play musical notes when a ball rolls over them.

![An image of the finished don't fall through project showing two controllable balls and a grid of 64 tiles. The balls can each be controlled by a different player using keyboard keys. The aim is to get to the platform past the grid of tiles. The tiles change colour when you roll the ball on to them. Some are safe, others fall away.](images/dont-fall-through.png)

If you want to have more fun exploring Unity, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=unity).

If you want to create your own material to add to your mirror ball you could try out the [Blender - Add material effects to a marble](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-marble) project. 

If you want to create your own tiled floor you could try out the [Blender - Create a 3D tiled floor](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-tiled-floor) project.
