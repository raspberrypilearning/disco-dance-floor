--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** 'Play' your project to see the spotlight over the ball. Use the keys to move the ball. The spotlight will stay in the same position.
 
Press the 'Play' button again to stop running your project. 

--- /task ---

### Make the spotlight follow the ball

--- task ---

Go to the Hierarchy window and select the 'Ball' GameObject.

In the Inspector window, go to 'Add Component' and search for 'Script' and choose 'New script'.

Name the new script 'SpotlightController' and drag it into the Scripts folder.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Double-click on the 'SpotlightController' script to open it and enter the following code:

--- code ---
---
language: cs
filename: SpotlightController.cs
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 
---
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
public class SpotlightController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject Spotlight;
    Vector3 spotOffset;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        spotOffset = Spotlight.transform.position - this.transform.position;
    }


    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        Spotlight.transform.position = this.transform.position + spotOffset;
    }
}

--- /code ---

**Save** and return to Unity.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Select the 'Ball' GameObject in the Hierarchy window. 

The 'SpotlightController' script needs to know which Spotlight it should use.

Drag the 'Spotlight' GameObject to the Spotlight variable in the Inspector window.
