## You will make

Create a tiled disco dance floor. Tilt the floor to roll a mirror ball over the tiles to change their colour and play sounds.

You will:

+ Create a skybox material and add it to the scene
+ Create a level that you can tilt to move a ball around
+ Add a spotlight and amend the directional light to create different lighting effects
+ Apply sounds and random colours to an object on collision

--- no-print ---

Control the rotation of the dance floor using <kbd>WASD</kbd> (or <kbd>ZQSD</kbd>) or the arrow keys. See and hear what happens when you the ball rolls over a tile.
