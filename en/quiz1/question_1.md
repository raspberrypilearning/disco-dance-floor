In your project, you added a dark **skybox** to provide a background to your Scene. What did you create to add a skybox?

  Not quite, you do use light settings to render the skybox in the scene but the skybox itself is not a light GameObject.

  --- feedback ---

  That’s correct. A skybox is a material with a specific shader applied. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) A camera setting

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite, the camera will see the skybox behind all the other objects but it is not a setting of the camera.
