legend: Question 3 of 3

In your project you used some **Materials**. Is it possible to add the same Material to more than one game object at once?

--- choices ---

- (x) Yes


  --- feedback ---

  Thatâ€™s correct. If you hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> you can select multiple GameObjects and add a Material in the Inspector window.

- ( ) No

   Hmm, try again. In order to add the same Material to multiple objects you would have to select them all. Is there a way to select more than one GameObject in the Hierarchy window?
