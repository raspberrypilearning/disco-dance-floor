In your project you used a **Tag**. Is it possible to add the same tag to more than one game object?

- (x) Yes

  That’s correct. You tagged all of your tiles with the ‘Tile’ tag. This is a much more efficient way to script in Unity.

- ( ) No

   Hmm try again. You can assign the same tag to multiple objects, in fact one of the main reasons to use tags is to save time scripting the same behaviour for multiple objects.
